ðŸ§  Binary Decoder

This is a simple binary decoder written in Python.

ðŸ”¹ Currently, it takes a single binary number as input and converts it to its decimal form.
ðŸ”¹ The goal is to expand this project into a powerful binary interpreter that can handle any format of binary input â€” including:

Strings ("01001000")

Lists of bits ([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0])

Space-separated binaries ("01001000 01100101")

Lists of binary blocks ([[0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0], [0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1]])

ðŸ”¸ Future features will include:

Input format detection

ASCII character decoding (e.g. binary â†’ "Honzik")

Full message decoding from binary text

This repo is part of a larger learning journey and will continue evolving over time.
